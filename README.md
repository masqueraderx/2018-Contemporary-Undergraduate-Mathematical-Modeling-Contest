# 2018-Contemporary-Undergraduate-Mathematical-Modeling-Contest
We solved the Problem B with MATLAB and were nominated as National First Prize. In addition, we published a paper in ISMII 2019.

The folder includes two subfolders and a PDF. 

1. "2018-B-Chinese" Folder includes Introduction to Problem B and the data given by contest committee. To run the code, you need to add these excels into the "Code" Folder.

2. "Code Folder" includes all the codes. In "第一问第一种程序" folder, we stimulated the whole procedure in use of Greedy Algorithm. In "第一问第二种程序" folder, we improves our 
 ways by combining the Random Selection Alogrithm with Greedy Algorithm. And the results turned out more optimal than before. In "第二问" folder, we used our established model 
 to stimulate the double process. In "第三问一种故障" folder, we were handling the single process under breakdown condition. In "第三问两种故障" folder, we were handling the double
 process under break down condition. In "甘特图" folder, we drew the Gantt chart for all conditions.
 
3. "An Effective Method for Dynamic Global Optimal Scheduling of RGV Based on Probability Function" is the paper we published. It explained how we established our model and
improved it.

Thanks!
